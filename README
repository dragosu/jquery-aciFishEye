aciFishEye - Cross-browser FishEye menu with jQuery and CSS.

It's not too much to explain, allmost 100% of the implementation must be done in HTML/CSS,
the plugin itself only provides the means to resize the menu items based on mouse position.
Make sure you provide a non-JavaScript version (check the examples with JS disabled in your browser
to see it working, also you can try check the examples in a 'transition' enabled browser
to be able to see the CSS effects on mouse over/out).

Simple usage:

$().ready(function(){

    $('.fishEye').aciFishEye();

});

Note: this is for the HTML structure and the CSS that came with the examples.
Check them (and the plugin initialization options) too see how can achieve the FishEye menu
with other HTML structure and other CSS rules, depending on your needs.
